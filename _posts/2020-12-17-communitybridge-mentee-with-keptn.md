Hey folks, I am Ankit Jain, and currently working as an Infrastructure (DevOps) Engineer at Razorpay. I have successfully graduated from the Keptn mentorship program. In this blog post, I will be sharing my experience of contributing to [Keptn](https://keptn.sh/), CNCF sandbox project as a Linux Foundation's [CommunityBridge](https://communitybridge.org/) Program Mentee.
