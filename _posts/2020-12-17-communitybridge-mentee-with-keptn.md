Hey folks, I am Ankit Jain, and currently working as an Infrastructure (DevOps) Engineer at Razorpay. I have successfully graduated from the Keptn mentorship program. In this blog post, I will be sharing my experience of contributing to [Keptn](https://keptn.sh/), CNCF sandbox project as a Linux Foundation's [CommunityBridge](https://communitybridge.org/) Program Mentee.

# What is CommunityBridge Program?

CommunityBridge program is the Linux Foundation's initiative to indulge more people in the open-source community similar to Google Summer of Code and Outreachy. Each selected Mentee works on an open-source project for a term of 3 months approx under the assigned Mentors who guides and help them with the project completion.

I have been following the CNCF community and hence got to know about this program and thinking to apply for this program from last one year but unfortunately either I miss the deadline or stuck in something else. I have been constantly trying to make some good open-source contribution to CNCF projects. It's kinda challenging to find proper time for the open-source contribution along with a full-time job which is equally amazing and exciting.
