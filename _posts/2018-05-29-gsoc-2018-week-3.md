Week 2 of the GSoC coding period is completed successfully. [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (Google Summer of Code) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.

### **Project Abstract**

I am working on "**Developing a “ Product Advertising API ” module for Drupal 8**" - [#7](https://groups.drupal.org/node/518074). The “Product Advertising API” which is renamed to "[Affiliates Connect](https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect)" module provides an interface to easily integrate with affiliate APIs or product advertising APIs provided by different e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, eBay etc to fetch data easily from their database and import them into Drupal to monetize your website by advertising their products. If the e-commerce platforms don't provide affiliate APIs, we will scrape the data from such platforms.

### **Progress**

Some of the tasks accomplished in this week are - 

- The basic skeleton of the module is completed and reviewed by [borisson_](https://www.drupal.org/u/borisson_) , [dbjpanda](https://www.drupal.org/u/dbjpanda) , [gvso](https://www.drupal.org/u/gvso), [thedrupalkid](https://www.drupal.org/u/thedrupalkid) and other mentors. Link to the issue - [#2975659](https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect/issues/2975659)

- With the skeleton issue, The overview page which will show the different plugins enabled by the user is also completed.

- It will also show the fetcher status as shown in the above-attached image.

- Configuration Form for saving the configuration of the **affiliates_connect **settings is almost completed and is under review. Link to the issue - [#2976037](https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect/issues/2976037)

- Custom Project Entity for storing product's data from various vendors still needs some work and will be completed within this week and link to the issue - [#2975642](https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect/issues/2975642)

### **Week 3 - Goals**

In this week the basic module for developing/integrating the sub-modules will be completed and I will start working on the Scraper API which will be developed using Node.js and npm packages.

- As every vendor has a different configuration so configuration form will be added for the sub-modules.

- The common configuration will be inherited from the parent module which is completed in this issue - [#2976037](https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect/issues/2976037)

- Start working on Scraper API for sub-modules.

### **Difficulties**

- Most of the websites are using latest Front-end Frameworks like Angular, React etc so to fetch dynamic content from such websites, we need to use a Headless browser for which I am using [x-ray ](https://github.com/matthewmueller/x-ray)in Node.
