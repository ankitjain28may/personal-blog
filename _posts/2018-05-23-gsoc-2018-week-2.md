Week 1 of the GSoC coding period is completed successfully. [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (Google Summer of Code) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.

### **Project Abstract**

I am working on "**Developing a “ Product Advertising API ” module for Drupal 8**" - [#7](https://groups.drupal.org/node/518074). The “Product Advertising API” which is renamed to "[Affiliates Connect](https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect)" module provides an interface to easily integrate with affiliate APIs or product advertising APIs provided by different e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, eBay etc to fetch data easily from their database and import them into Drupal to monetize your website by advertising their products. If the e-commerce platforms don't provide affiliate APIs, we will scrape the data from such platforms.

### **Progress**

I am enjoying working on this project and learning new things. The module development progress and Code can be checked at this link - [Affiliates-Connect](https://github.com/Chiranjeeb2410/Affiliates-Connect/). Some of the tasks that were accomplished in the week - 1 are - 

- The basic skeleton of the module is ready.

- As the product's data is a common entity between all the vendors so the custom content entity that is needed to save the product's data is completed.

- Configuration Form for saving the configuration of the **affiliates_connect **settings is completed.

- Basic plugin manager is added to handle plugins that will be provided as the sub-module to this module.

As this module is similar to [Social Auth](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth) so I took help of [gvso](https://www.drupal.org/u/gvso) to understand the working of the social auth and its various implementers like [social_auth_facebook](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth_facebook/) and [social_auth_google](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth_google/). With his help, the project is more crystal clear to me and mentors are there to guide and review our code at each step.

### **Week 2 - Goals**

In this week the basic module for developing/integrating the sub-modules will be completed and I will start working on the Scraper API which will be developed using Node.js and npm packages.

- As every vendor has a different configuration so configuration form will be added for the sub-modules.

- The common configuration will be inherited from the parent module.

- Plugin Manager with all the required functionalities will be completed. 

- Start working on Scraper API for sub-modules.

### **Difficulties**

- Plugin Manager functionality needs to be defined accurately and precisely so that we can better manage the plugins and inherit common functionalities from the parent module.

- Most of the websites are using latest Front-end Frameworks like Angular, React e.t.c so to fetch dynamic content from such websites, we need to use a Headless browser for which I am using [x-ray ](https://github.com/matthewmueller/x-ray)in Node.
