This news that Microsoft has acquired Github, has trembled the developer community. No one has ever expected this and my perspective was the same, I really want that Github should remain an independent entity on which we developers can trust. But the scenario has completely changed, [Microsoft has acquired Github in $7.5 billion](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/), a home of millions of Developers.

### Developer's Reaction 

Due to a bad history of Microsoft, Developers find it difficult to adopt this change and they are thinking that Microsoft will ruin Github too as they did with other products like Nokia etc. Many developers are moving to Github,  a rival service **#movetogitlab**. Many developers are flowing with the flow and some are still deciding what they should have to do. I still think that Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub can empower developers. I like the User Interface of Github so I would like to stay with Github.

### Reason of acquisition 

Microsoft has acquired Skype, Minecraft, LinkedIn and none of these is a failure but they are developed further. Microsoft has changed quite a lot and now it is the world's largest open source contributor (according to Github). Github is the home of 24 million users collaborating on code with over 80 million repositories, Microsoft doesn't want to acquire their code but they want to provide developers more facilities. Microsoft's project i.e VS Code is loved by millions of developers, entirely open source, and built using GitHub’s Electron platform.

Microsoft is trying to get the attention of developers and they are thinking to empower Github with Microsoft  Azure, cloud computing service which is a good alternative to Amazon Web Services. They have mentioned to include the Microsoft IT technologies and services to Github. Microsoft mentioned in the blog post- 

```
GitHub will remain an open platform, which any developer can plug into and extend.
Developers will continue to be able to use the programming languages, tools and
operating systems of their choice for their projects – and will still be able to 
deploy their code on any cloud and any device.
```

Microsoft appeals to the developer that we are contributing to open source and are world largest open source contributor and some of our popular frameworks and projects are also opensource. So When it comes to our commitment to open source, judge us by the actions we have taken in the recent past, our actions today, and in the future.

I don't know what's the master plan of Microsoft behind the acquisition of Github but I really hope that it will all for empowering developers. Thanks for reading the article. Let me know your views in the comment section.
