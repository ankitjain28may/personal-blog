I"×<p>This news that Microsoft has acquired Github, has trembled the developer community. No one has ever expected this and my perspective was the same, I really want that Github should remain an independent entity on which we developersÂ can trust. But the scenario has completely changed, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/">Microsoft has acquired Github in $7.5 billion</a>, a home of millions of Developers.</p>
