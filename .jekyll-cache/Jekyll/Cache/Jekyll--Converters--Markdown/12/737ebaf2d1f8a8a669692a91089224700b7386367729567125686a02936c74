I"<p>In my previous blog post <strong><a href="http://ankitjain28.me/google-summer-code-2018-blog-1-preparation-drupal">Google Summer of Code 2018 - Blog 1 - preparation drupal</a></strong>, I have shared how I get started with open source and how I prepared for GSoCâ€™18 in last one month. Finally, the wait is over and the results came out. I am selected in Google Summer of Code 2018 under Drupal Organization. It is one of the happiest moments in my life till now. My attempts/efforts from the first year finally result in a success. I thank each and everyone who helped me on my way to achieving this. A big thanks to my mentors and friends who motivated me and helped me. <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5167774817583104">Result Page</a></p>
