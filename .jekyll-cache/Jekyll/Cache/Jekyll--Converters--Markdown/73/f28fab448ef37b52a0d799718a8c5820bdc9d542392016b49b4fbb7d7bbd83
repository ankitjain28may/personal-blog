I"|<p>In my previous blog post <strong><a href="http://ankitjain28.me/google-summer-code-2018-blog-1-preparation-drupal">Google Summer of Code 2018 - Blog 1 - preparation drupal</a></strong>, I have shared how I get started with open source and how I prepared for GSoC’18 in last one month. Finally, the wait is over and the results came out. I am selected in Google Summer of Code 2018 under Drupal Organization. It is one of the happiest moments in my life till now. My attempts/efforts from the first year finally result in a success. I thank each and everyone who helped me on my way to achieving this. A big thanks to my mentors and friends who motivated me and helped me. <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5167774817583104">Result Page</a></p>

<h3 id="project-abstract"><strong>Project Abstract</strong></h3>

<p>I am working on “<strong>Developing a “ Product Advertising API ” module for Drupal 8</strong>” - <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/518074">#7</a>. The “Product Advertising API” which is renamed to “<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect">Affiliates Connect</a>” module provides an interface to easily integrate with affiliate APIs or product advertising APIs provided by different e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, eBay etc to fetch data easily from their database and import them into Drupal to monetize your website by advertising their products. If the e-commerce platforms don’t provide affiliate APIs, we will scrape the data from such platforms.</p>

<p>Before Coding starts, Around 15-20 days are given to students to get familiar with mentors and organization people. It helps us in discussions and builds a good connection. I created a room on <a href="#affiliates-connect:matrix.org">IRC</a> and added all the mentors there to discuss things related to project. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/dbjpanda">Dibyajyoti Panda</a>, one of my mentor has assigned me a task before the coding phase. As per my task, I have to create a development environment so that it can help developers as well as mentors to review our code easily. I find this idea great and started working on this task.</p>

<p>This project helps in managing Drupal Workflow using <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. You can manage multiple sites like production/development and staging servers through this project, All your environment will setup, install dependencies and Sync Configuration in a single click.</p>

<p>I have worked on Git and Composer before but Ansible and Docker are like alien technologies for me. I love to explore new technologies so I brewed my coffee and selected my favorite playlist and started learning Ansible and Docker. I find both of them so cool that I am thinking now why I was not aware of such things before. Literally, I am in love with Docker. I want to explore and learn Docker more.</p>

<p>As of now, Most of the work on this project is completed, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/dbjpanda">Dbjpanda</a> is reviewing my code continuously on <a href="https://github.com/dbjpanda/drupal-devops">Github</a> and suggested improvements on which I am working on. I had a Hangout session with him to show my progress. Continuous Integration and Deployment are also equally important for any good project. I am using Travis CI for it where a user can check whether his tests are working fine/ or his push has broken the code. After the successful build, Travis will deploy the code on the deploying server automatically using Ansible.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-people"><strong>Connecting People</strong></h3>

<p>During the preparation for GSoC’18, I was continuously contributing to Drupal queues, writing patches and reviewing patches. Each credit for resolving issues inspires me to work harder. I connected with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/borisson_">Joris Vercammen</a> while writing patches and on request, he reviewed my proposal and his feedbacks helped me in improving my proposal.</p>

<p>I got in touch with other students who get selected in GSoC this year. I talked to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/chiranjeeb2410">Chiranjeeb Mahanta</a> and helped him in installing Drupal with docker through the project I am working on.</p>

<p>While working on the project, I get in touch with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paritoshik-paul-681a2758/">Paritoshik Paul</a> on LinkedIn through Dbjpanda. We have a small conversation over this project as Paritoshik has created a similar module in D7 i.e <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/paritoshikpaul/2709737">Flipkart API</a> so he is also joining us as a mentor. I also find that  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/gvso">Getulio Valentin Sánchez</a> also wants to mentor this project, so I am trying to get in touch with him. I have sent a mail to him through the Drupal contact form, waiting for his approval. I will work hard and learn new stuff while working with such experienced folks.</p>
