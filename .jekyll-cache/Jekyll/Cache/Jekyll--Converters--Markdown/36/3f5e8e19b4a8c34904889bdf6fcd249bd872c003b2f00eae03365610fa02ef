<h3 id="project-abstract"><strong>Project Abstract</strong></h3>

<p>I am working on “<strong>Developing a “ Product Advertising API ” module for Drupal 8</strong>” - <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/518074">#7</a>. The “Product Advertising API” which is renamed to “<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect">Affiliates Connect</a>” module provides an interface to easily integrate with affiliate APIs or product advertising APIs provided by different e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, eBay etc to fetch data easily from their database and import them into Drupal to monetize your website by advertising their products. If the e-commerce platforms don’t provide affiliate APIs, we will scrape the data from such platforms.</p>

    <p>As every vendor has a different configuration so configuration form will be added for the sub-modules.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The common configuration will be inherited from the parent module which is completed in this issue - <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect/issues/2976037">#2976037</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="difficulties"><strong>Difficulties</strong></h3>

<p>- Most of the websites are using latest Front-end Frameworks like Angular, React etc so to fetch dynamic content from such websites, we need to use a Headless browser for which I am using <a href="https://github.com/matthewmueller/x-ray">x-ray </a>in Node.</p>
