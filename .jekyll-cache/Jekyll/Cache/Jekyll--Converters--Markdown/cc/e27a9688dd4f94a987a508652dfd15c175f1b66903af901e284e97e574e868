I"º<p>Week 1 of the GSoC coding period is completed successfully. <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a>Â (Google Summer of Code) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3-month programming project during their break from school.</p>

<h3 id="project-abstract"><strong>Project Abstract</strong></h3>

<p>I am working on â€œ<strong>Developing a â€œ Product Advertising API â€ module for Drupal 8</strong>â€ -Â <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/518074">#7</a>. The â€œProduct Advertising APIâ€ which is renamed to â€œ<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/affiliates_connect">Affiliates Connect</a>â€ module provides an interface to easily integrate with affiliate APIs or product advertising APIs provided by different e-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, eBay etc to fetch data easily from their database and import them into Drupal to monetize your website by advertising their products. If the e-commerce platforms donâ€™t provide affiliate APIs, we will scrape the data from such platforms.</p>

<h3 id="progress"><strong>Progress</strong></h3>

<p>I am enjoying working on this project and learning new things. The module development progress and Code can be checked at this link -Â <a href="https://github.com/Chiranjeeb2410/Affiliates-Connect/">Affiliates-Connect</a>. Some of the tasks thatÂ were accomplished in the week - 1 are -Â </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The basic skeleton of the module is ready.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the productâ€™s data is a common entity between all the vendors so the custom content entity that isÂ needed to save the productâ€™s data is completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Configuration Form for saving the configuration of the <strong>affiliates_connectÂ </strong>settings is completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basic plugin manager is added to handle plugins that will be provided as the sub-module to this module.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As this module is similar to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth">Social Auth</a>Â so I took help ofÂ <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/gvso">gvso</a>Â to understand the working of the social auth and its various implementers like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth_facebook/">social_auth_facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth_google/">social_auth_google</a>. With his help, the project is more crystal clear to me and mentors are there to guide and review our code at each step.</p>

<h3 id="week-2---goals"><strong>Week 2 - Goals</strong></h3>

<p>In this week the basic module for developing/integrating the sub-modules will be completed and I will start working on the Scraper API which will be developed using Node.js and npm packages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As every vendor has a different configurationÂ so configuration form will be added for the sub-modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The common configuration will be inherited from the parent module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plugin Manager with all the required functionalities will be completed.Â </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start working on Scraper API for sub-modules.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="difficulties"><strong>Difficulties</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Plugin Manager functionality needs to be defined accurately and precisely so that we can better manage the plugins and inherit common functionalities from the parent module.</li>
</ul>

<p>-Â Most of the websites are using latest Front-end Frameworks like Angular, React e.t.c so to fetch dynamic content from such websites, we need to use a Headless browser for which I am usingÂ <a href="https://github.com/matthewmueller/x-ray">x-rayÂ </a>in Node.</p>
